    <h2> CarrieThemHome Animal Foundation's Mission:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Our goal is to educate, advocate, sponsor, and support the animal rescue community. We do this by connecting with rescue organizations and people to help find foster and forever homes for rescued animals. We contribute funding to qualified animal organizations to help rescue, transport and provide medical services to animals in need. We work with legislators to update and change legislation focused on animal welfare, and we reach out to the community to educate about puppy mills, animal adoption, and the importance of spay/neuter. </li>
    <li>Founded by Carrie Thomas, who after adopting and transporting rescue dogs, completing home visits for rescue organizations, coordinating fundraisers, and working with legislators, saw how impactful one person's rescue work could be on the lives of animals. To grow this impact, we've created this website to be a way to stay current with activities that save lives.</li>
    <li>Located north of Boston, Massachusetts (U.S.), we focus on local rescue initiatives, and when possible, support rescue efforts nationwide. Come back soon to this site to see additional resources and ways you can help.</li>
