<h2>Rescue Road Warriors</h2>

<h5>https://www.facebook.com/makingtheroadtofreedomlessruff/</h5>
<p>
One of the organizations we support is Rescue Road Warriors. We've transported for this well-run all-volunteer group that transports dogs (and cats) from high-risk shelters to permanent 'furever' homes. This non-profit organization coordinates transport to approved rescue organizations and is always looking for additional transporters. We're glad to help you become a transporter!

Starting in September 2018, I joined The Humane Society of the United States as a volunteer District Leader here in Massachusetts, for the 6th District. I am part of a passionate group of animal advocates from the East Coast to the West Coast, and help in advocating for Humane Laws.
